This program can lock any files

in current situation:

When encryption.py is run, all files with the extension .txt will be encoded in this directory
Every file that is coded contains a token that is specific to that file and a key that is for all the txt files in this directory.

It opens text files, encrypts the contents and saves each file's special token in a new file with the same name  with the extension .Keylogger.

The key of the encrypted files is stored in a file called key_Files.txt

If you do not have the token of each file and the key, you cannot decrypt any file.

decrypt requires two things :
1. token : Each file has its own token
2. The key that is the same for all encrypted files
